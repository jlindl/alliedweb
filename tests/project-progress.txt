Project scan and progress report for allied-website
Date: 2025-09-24

Summary
-------
This report inventories the repository, current Git status, what's done, and recommended next steps.

Project root files (not exhaustive):
- .git/
- .gitignore
- .next/
- eslint.config.mjs
- LLM.txt
- next-env.d.ts
- next.config.ts
- package-lock.json
- package.json
- postcss.config.mjs
- public/
- README.md
- scripts/
- src/
- tsconfig.json

Key source folders:
- src/app: contains Next.js app pages and layout (many pages under insurance-services)
- src/components: UI components (Header, Footer, StayInTouch, etc.)
- src/lib: small helper (rss.ts)

Git status (summary)
--------------------
- Repository initialized (branch: master).
- Many new/uncommitted files are staged as added (A) or modified (M). See Git for full list.

What's done
-----------
- Next.js app skeleton exists (app directory, layout, pages).
- Multiple service pages under `src/app/insurance-services/` created.
- UI components available under `src/components/`.
- `package.json` and devDependencies configured for Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind.
- `README.md` present.

What's left / recommended next steps
------------------------------------
1) Commit changes to Git
   - Stage and commit remaining files. If you want remote published to GitHub, add remote and push. VS Code UI can create/publish the repo automatically.

2) Configure Git user identity (if not set globally):
   - `git config user.name "Your Name"`
   - `git config user.email "you@example.com"`

3) Add test setup
   - No test framework is present in `package.json`. Consider adding `vitest` or `jest` and basic tests.

4) CI/CD and linting
   - Add GitHub Actions or other CI to run `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint` on PRs.

5) Accessibility and SEO checks
   - Run Lighthouse and accessibility audits for key pages.

6) Clean up / housekeeping
   - Verify `.gitignore` covers OS, IDE, and build artifacts.
   - Remove large files from history or move to a `assets/` CDN if necessary.

7) Local dev validation
   - Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to validate the app builds and runs.

Edge cases / notes
- The repo currently uses `master` as default branch; consider renaming to `main` for consistency with many services.
- No test framework configured yet.
- Binary assets (images) are included; consider size checking before pushing to remote.

Files changed/created by this report
- tests/project-progress.txt (this file)

Status: Actionable â€” ready for final commit and optional push to remote.

How I can help next
- Commit and push to your GitHub repo (you can provide the remote URL or let VS Code publish automatically).
- Add a basic test harness (Vitest + 1 simple component test).
- Configure GitHub Actions for CI.
