            <li>we may allow a potential acquirer or merger partner to review our databases, although we would restrict their use and disclosure of this data during the diligence phase and direct them to treat the data confidentially;</li>
            <li>as required by law enforcement, regulatory bodies, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable to our Company; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our agreements or Company policies; and</li>
            <li>other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Please note that these third parties may be in other countries outside of the UK and the European Union where the laws on
            processing personal information may differ. We will only do so where we are satisfied that sufficient levels of protection
            are in place as required by applicable data protection laws.
          </p>

          <h3>Our Security Measures to Protect your Personal Information</h3>

          </p>

          <h3>Your Rights</h3>
          <p>
            We will retain any personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the business purpose it was
            collected. We will also retain and use your personal information for as long as necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

            <li>Rectify personal information you think is inaccurate</li>

          <p>
            In some cases, where you make a request concerning your personal information we may not be required or able to carry
            out your request as this may result in us not being able to fulfil our legal and regulatory obligations under the lawful
            processing conditions in which we hold your data or because there is a minimum statutory period of time for which we have
            to keep your information. In such cases, we will inform you of our reasons.
