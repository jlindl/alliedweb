Prepared by: Development Team

Executive summary
-----------------
The Allied Insurance Services website is a Next.js (app router) project that has a functional layout, multiple service pages, and a library of reusable components. The core site structure is implemented and ready for content completion, QA, and deployment. The project is currently in a pre-release stage: most pages and UI components exist but require review, content finalisation, and testing.

Current status (high level)
---------------------------
- Framework: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript.
- Project skeleton: Complete with `src/app` structure, `layout.tsx`, global styles, and page components.
- Content pages: Many service pages under `src/app/insurance-services/` implemented as page components.
- Components: Header, Footer, Hero, QuoteForm, TestimonialsCarousel, StayInTouch, and various visual components present in `src/components/`.
- Utilities: RSS helper in `src/lib/rss.ts` and a script `scripts/inspectRss.js` for RSS inspection.
- Local development: `package.json` contains scripts to run dev, build, start, and lint.
- Version control: The repository is initialized locally and changes exist ready to commit/push.

Work completed
--------------
- Site architecture and navigation implemented.
- Core UI components created and wired into pages.
- Many insurance service pages scaffolded and implemented.
- Asset folder populated with required images and logos.
- Build tooling and linting dependencies are declared in `package.json`.

Remaining work (detailed)
-------------------------
1. Content finalisation
   - Proof and approve page copy, imagery, and SEO metadata for each service page.
   - Localise or adapt any sector-specific language where needed.

2. Visual polish and responsive QA
   - Cross-device layout testing and adjustments (mobile/tablet/desktop).
   - Ensure images are optimised for web (responsive sizes and compression).

3. Accessibility and SEO
   - Run accessibility audits (Lighthouse, axe) and fix issues.
   - Add structured data (JSON-LD) and meta tags where necessary.

4. Testing
   - Add unit and integration tests (suggest Vitest + React Testing Library).
   - Add end-to-end smoke tests for main flows (e.g., get-a-quote form).

5. Performance optimisations
   - Audit bundle sizes and remove unused dependencies.
   - Implement lazy-loading for heavy visual components if needed.

6. CI/CD and deployment
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run lint/build/tests on PRs.
   - Create deployment pipeline (Vercel recommended for Next.js) and set up preview environments.

7. Security and compliance
   - Review and secure environment variables and third-party keys.
   - Ensure HTTPS, CSP, and basic security headers via hosting provider.

8. Final sign-off and go-live
   - Content approval, final QA, UAT with stakeholders, and schedule go-live.

Risks and considerations
------------------------
- Several pages contain placeholder or draft content — this can delay go-live if content is not finalised.
- Large image assets are included in the repository; before pushing to remote, consider optimising or using CDN storage.
- No test suite currently — introducing tests early reduces regression risk.

Estimated effort to complete (rough)
------------------------------------
- Content finalisation: 1–2 weeks (depending on stakeholder responsiveness).
- QA & accessibility fixes: 2–5 days.
- Tests & CI integration: 3–5 days.
- Deployment setup and verification: 1–2 days.

Immediate recommended next steps
--------------------------------
1. Finalise content for all service pages and the homepage.
2. Commit and push the current repository to the company GitHub organization.
3. Enable Vercel deployment and set up preview deployments for PRs.
4. Add basic unit tests and a CI workflow to run them on PRs.
5. Perform accessibility and performance audits, then prioritise fixes.

Attachments
-----------
- `tests/project-progress.txt` — raw inventory and state (developer-focused).

If you'd like, I can:
- Prepare a short deck (3–5 slides) summarising this report for the MD.
- Create the GitHub repo, push the code, and set up Vercel deployment.
- Add a starter test and CI workflow.
