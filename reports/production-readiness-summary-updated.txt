Production readiness summary — updated after gating logs
Date: 2025-10-17

Summary
-------
This report updates the previous production-readiness assessment after implementing gated logging across API routes and major client/server components.

Quick status
------------
- Logging: UPDATED — added `src/lib/logger.ts` and replaced raw console calls in core API routes and major visual components with the gated logger. Verbose logs are disabled in production by default.
- Missing asset `/images/products-bg.png`: STILL MISSING — referenced by `src/app/insurance-services/InsuranceServicesPage.tsx`.
- CSS at-rule error: STILL PRESENT — `src/app/globals.css` contains `@theme inline` causing an "Unknown at rule" error.
- Other console usages: SOME REMAIN — scripts and a few client pages still use console.* (see details below).

Details
-------
What was changed
- Added `src/lib/logger.ts`.
- Replaced console calls in:
  - `src/app/api/quote/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/claims/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/stay-in-touch/route.ts`
  - `src/lib/rss.ts` (gated)
  - `src/components/LightRays.tsx`, `src/components/plasmabackground.tsx`, `src/components/Particles.tsx` (gated)

Remaining console usages (examples)
- `src/app/claims/page.tsx` — `console.error('Claim submit failed', ...)` (client-side page form error logging)
- `scripts/inspectRss.js` — uses console.log and console.error (development script; okay to keep but note)
- `src/lib/logger.ts` itself uses console.* to output logs in non-production (intended)

Remaining blockers
- Missing image: `/images/products-bg.png` referenced in `src/app/insurance-services/InsuranceServicesPage.tsx`.
- CSS at-rule error in `src/app/globals.css` around `@theme inline` (fix required to avoid build errors under stricter PostCSS/Tailwind configs).

Next recommended actions (prioritized)
1) Replace the missing background image reference (quick):
   - Option A: change to existing `/images/factory.jpg` in `InsuranceServicesPage.tsx`.
   - Option B: add `products-bg.png` to `public/images` if you have the intended asset.

2) Fix `src/app/globals.css`:
   - Remove or replace `@theme inline` with valid Tailwind directives or PostCSS plugin usage.

3) Clean remaining console usage:
   - Replace client-page console.error calls with UI-friendly error reporting (and use logger if you want debugging gated).
   - Optionally convert development scripts to use a debug flag instead of raw console logging.

4) Optional: Replace the simple logger with a structured logging library (pino/winston) if you need JSON logs and integration with log collectors.

Commands to verify
------------------
:: clear next cache and start dev
rmdir /s /q .next
npm run dev

:: run production build to surface build-time errors
npm run build

Files created/updated
---------------------
- `src/lib/logger.ts` (new)
- Updated API routes and visual components to use logger
- `reports/production-readiness-summary-updated.txt` (this file)

I can apply the quick missing-image fix and/or fix `globals.css` now. Which should I do first? If you want both, I can apply both in the same pass and re-run the build to verify.
