Final notes
-----------
If you prefer, we can pre-fill templated content for all service pages using standardised copy which you can then edit. Indicate whether you would like:
- Full pre-fill (devs write draft copy for all pages), or
- Outline only (MD provides final copy for each page).

Please respond inline in this document or provide a separate CSV/Google Sheet with the same fields for each page. Once we have content, we will complete the pages, run QA, and publish.
